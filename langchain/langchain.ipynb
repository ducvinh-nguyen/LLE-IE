       "['Steel Steel  is an alloy  of iron  and carbon  with improved strength  and fracture resistance  compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels , which are resistant to corrosion  and oxidation , typically  need an additional 11% chromium . Because  of its high tensile strength  and low cost, steel is used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, bicycles, machines, electrical appliances, furniture, and weapons. Iron is the base metal of steel. Depending on the temperature, it can take two crystalline forms (allotropic forms):  body-centred cubi c and face-centred cubic . The interaction of the allotropes of iron  with the alloying elements, primari ly carbon, gives steel and cast iron  their range of unique properties. In pure iron, the crystal structure  has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easil y formed',\n",
       " \"In pure iron, the crystal structure  has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easil y formed. In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight. Varying the amount of carbon and many  other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), impedes the movement of the dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. These qualities include the hardness , quenching behaviour , need for annealing , tempering behavio ur, yield strength , and tensile strength  of the resulting steel. The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility\",\n",
       " \"The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility. Steel was produced in bloomery  furnaces for thous ands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast furnace  and production of crucible steel . This was followed by the Bessemer process  in England  in the mid-19th century, and then by the open-hearth furna ce. With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced  steel began. Mild steel  replaced wrought iron. The German states  saw majo r steel prowess over Europe in the 19th century,[1] and the American steel production industry was manufactured in cities such as Pittsburgh  and Cleveland  until the late 20th century\"]"

      " Steel Steel  is an alloy  of iron  and carbon  with improved strength  and fracture resistance  compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels , which are resistant to corrosion  and oxidation , typically  need an additional 11% chromium . Because  of its high tensile strength  and low cost, steel is used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, bicycles, machines, electrical appliances, furniture, and weapons. Iron is the base metal of steel. Depending on the temperature, it can take two crystalline forms (allotropic forms):  body-centred cubi c and face-centred cubic . The interaction of the allotropes of iron  with the alloying elements, primari ly carbon, gives steel and cast iron  their range of unique properties. In pure iron, the crystal structure  has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easil y formed\n",

      "Steel is produced through a process called steelmaking, which involves reducing the carbon content of iron and adding other elements. In modern facilities, the initial product is continuously cast into long slabs and then cut and shaped into various forms. The increase in steel's strength compared to iron is achieved by reducing iron's ductility. The production of steel began on a large scale in the 17th century with the introduction of more efficient methods like the blast furnace and the Bessemer process. Further refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking, have lowered the cost and increased the quality of steel production. Thanks for asking!\n"
